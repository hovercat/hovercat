## Hi!

If you are from choir and need access to the sheet music repos, send me a message.

If you are a bioinformatician and want to use my SELEX/Aptamer repositories, be sure to check out Jan Hoinka's SELEX software tools first.
They are much higher quality and proven.
Our tools worked okay for our use cases, but I wouldn't claim them to be correct, functional or error-free.

Hit me up if you want to at aschl@posteo.at - bussi
